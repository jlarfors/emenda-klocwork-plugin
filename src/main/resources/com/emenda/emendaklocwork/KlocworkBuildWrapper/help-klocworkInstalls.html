  <h2>Klocwork Installations</h2>
  <p>
      Please note this is a very simple piece of functionality intended for a
      "basic" Jenkins setup. If you use other plugins, such as the
      <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Custom+Tools+Plugin">CustomToolsPlugin</a>
      to handle installations and the PATH for other tools, then I suggest
      you skip this altogether and setup the Klocwork PATH as you would your
      other tools.
  </p>
  <p>
      If you do not use something like the CustomToolsPlugin and do not have the
      Klocwork PATH configured already... Please proceed.
  </p>
  <h3>What does this do?</h3>
  <p>
      It simply adds the provided PATH to the PATH variable for a job. Create an
      installation with a name and reference it on the job under the Build Environment
      settings. If using both the Klocwork server and desktop tools be careful
      of Unix vs Windows, and using the correct PATH separator (e.g. ";" vs ":")
  </p>
  <p>
      e.g. I could create an installation called WindowsBuildSlaves, with
      the paths: C:\Klocwork\Server\bin;C:\Klocwork\Desktop\bin
      This will then get added to the existing %PATH% variable
  </p>
  <p>
      The plugin will call /bin/sh or cmd.exe and provide the Klocwork
      executables without a path, so you have to ensure that Klocwork is setup
      in your path
